<h1>The Best Movies According to Milda</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>
<hr  />
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>One of my favorite movie. I love the magic world.</p>
<h3>Practical magic</h3>
<p>I get this sort of empathy towards these witches and a feeling of nostalgia for the 90's.</p>
<h3>Midsommar</h3>
<p> I like psychological horror movies and this one is the best.</p>
